## Getting Started

The physics framework provides numerous tools for interacting with the physics systems that have been implemented. Refer to the following information on how to install and use the application.

### Dependencies
To use the framework, the following prerequisites must be met.
* Windows 10+
* Visual Studio
* Git Version Control

The framework relies on the following libraries and APIs to function.
* DirectX 11
* ImGui

### Installing

To download a copy of the framework, select "Download ZIP" from the main code repository page, or create a fork of the project. More information on forking a GitHub respository can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTolZqmZq6s).

### Executing program

As the project settings have been modified to support the addition of the aforementioned libraries and APIs, there are no additional steps required to execute the application.
